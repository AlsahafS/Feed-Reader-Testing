# Feed Reader Testing Project
Feed Reader Testing is web-based application that reads RSS feeds.<br />
I used **Jasmine** to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application.

## Steps to run:
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open ```index.html ``` file.
3. **Jasmine**  test results should be displayed at the bottom of ```index.html ``` page.
